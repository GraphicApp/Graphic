General flow of presentation:
-start with brett, show app while nothing has been collected. Show settings page and talk about back end options.
Set it up so that cpu memory temp and network are all being collected, pick intervals that are different but make sense for presentation.

-move on to dashboard page where jason talks about visual data in table form. talks about process of learning react and setting up electron- trying out different databases and what not. shows the crowd how different buttons would give different values of data- still need to work on this page

-move on to monitor page where sid and brayden talk about struggles of gettting working graphs on page. Brayden- talks about d3 and react, sid talks about formatting data. On this page sid can control graphs while brayden talks about what it is we see on screen.

-end with brett talking about use cases of this app and how in this demonstration we only showed 3 hour time select, but in perfect world a user would leave this running to see trends over time.

Sid:
-using victoryjs and react.
-getting data from backend
-formatting data from 4 billion bytes to something readable on screen.
react components and how they deal with rendering graphs instead of text - not too different- just set up graphs to take in a prop from a button click.

brayden:
-d3 and react.
-faux dom, reactd3, having d3 do math while react does rendering, things we tried.
-experience with Victory
-experience with hosting

brett:
-what the app is, what the app does, and everything backend

Jason:
-electron and react
-going through the dashboard page
